# pyDiscordBot Version 0.2.0

A basic 
 >By [@AndroxxTraxxon](https://github.com/AndroxxTraxxon) - David Culbreth

## Requirements
 - Python 3.6 (NOT COMPATIBLE WITH 3.5 OR 3.7... I used type hints. removing those should get it running in 3.0 - 3.6)
 - [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
 - An [Application/Bot Token from Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro)


## Getting Started
Assuming you have Python and discord.py installed, and this repo downloaded...
 - make sure that the bot is authorized on your server 
   -[Adding your bot to your server](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Adding-Your-Bot-To-Your-Server)
 - make a copy of `botToken.py.sample`, and rename it to `botToken.py` 
   - *(the .gitignore keeps this out to help hide your secret token.)*
 - Inside `botToken.py`, add the string value of your token from the discord developer API as the value:
   - `value = "kajhsbgdfkjhas.aksdhfj.akjsdhg-fkuywe"` <== not a real value, put yours in like that.
 - Your bot needs a default channel to speak up on. add `home_channel` as the channel id of the desired home channel for the bot.
   - Note that this is where the bot will output any error messages, etc. 
     So don't make this a channel that people regularly talk on. I made a new one called `bot_spam` just for the bot.
   - This **channel id** can be retrieved by right clicking on the channel inside the Discord application,
     in the list of channels on the server.
   - `home_channel = "209384570293574987"` <== also not a real value, but your channel id will look like this.
   - Note that it is a ***string*** value. that is what the Discord API is expecting. Changing it to an int may have unexpected results.
     
## Running the bot
To run the bot in the console, move to the `src` directory, and run the `main.py` file with Python 3.6.


```console
> cd \path\to\pyDiscordBot\src
> python main.py
```
The bot should start running, and it will look something like this...
```
Initializing...
Logged in as <Your Bot Name> <Your Bot UserID>
Loading settings...
```
At this point, the bot should appear as online within Discord. 

## Using commands
The commands on this bot can be used by mentioning the bot at the beginning of the command,
and then writing the command, or by writing the 'calling card' (`.\` by default) before the command.

Running out of the box, you should be able to get the list of commands available to a standard user by typing `.\help` in any of the channels that the bot has access to.
## Adding new commands
All commands must follow the following format:
```python
async def my_function(message:discord.Message):
    ...
    <my_function logic here>
    ...
```
Then, the function and its accessible name (the name you type in the console) must be added to the appropriate commandsList:
```python
commandsList = {
    "help"  : dispHelp,
    ... ,
    ... ,
    "my_func_call" : my_function,
}
```
Once this has been done (and the file has been saved), you can `.\sudo update` in one of the bot's channels to refresh the botFunctions module, and `.\my_func_call` to call your new command.

### Adding Docstrings
The 'help' function uses the docstring notation with a custom tag to provide the information to the user. This allows the helpful documentation that is available to the developers to be simultaneously available to benefit the end user. 

Currently, the two docstring tags that are used by the help function are the `@usage` and the `@summary` tags. Adding these will allow the help function to natively support your function and provide help to your users.

## Hot-Swapping Functions
A core functionality of this bot is that its command set can be updated while the bot is still running. 
the command to do so is to write `.\sudo update` in the command line. 
This will trigger a `git fetch & git pull` by default (use `.\sudo update local` to just update with local changes) and reload the botFunctions
